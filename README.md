===========

IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------
mathematics gem introduced/relied on "Prior Knowledge"
(See https://github.com/nvijayap/mathematics)
In continuation of that style/paradigm of programming,
this program relies on elements of "Prior Knowledge"
in the domain of Physics, and avoids
computation where unnecessary.

About KBS:
---------
KBS: Knowledge Base Space
Some Examples for KBS:
. Local Cache
. Remote Cache
. Use of Marshall/Unmarshall
. Cache <=> DataStore (Activation/Passivation)
. Web Service
. Internet
Prior Knowledge of the pattern/computation process/history
shall lend to the path/approach to take.
